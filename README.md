# pandas-challenge
In this challenge, I used merge, group by, aggregate, and other functions to analyze standardized test results and various information about the reporting schools in order to identify trends in school performance. First, I used aggregation functions to assemble a high-level district summary. Then, I did an in-depth school summary to show results for each school. Once I had these results in a DataFrame, I pulled the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools by overall passing percentage using .sort_values(). Next, I grouped test scores by grade. Finally, I created bins to analyze scores by school spending, school size, and school type. From my analysis, two conclusions I have arrived at that I would like to highlight are: first, across all metrics, school spending (per student) correlates negatively with test results; and second, test results also correlate negatively with school size. As both spending and size increase, pass rates fall.
